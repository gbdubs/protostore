# Protostore

The goal of this project is to provide a basic CRUD UI + Backend for arbitrary protos.

## Known Issues

- Investigate and fix the `inside a test was not wrapped in act` issues.
- Use CSS modules to stop requiring JS + CSS coordination.
- Rather than importing all of `antd`, use `babel-plugin-import` to reduce build size.
